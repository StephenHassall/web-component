## Learn Web Component

Web components are a well established standard for building custom elements for any web project.

Creating you own custom HTML tags can make web development easier and simpler to do. Build a reusable component, with some simply attributes, that hides away all of the complexity within.

Web components are a great tool, that, when given the time to understand and master, can take the stress away from the constant new releases of modern web frameworks.

They work off well established web standards that will not change in the future, so something you create today should work many years from now.
