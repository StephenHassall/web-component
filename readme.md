## Web Component examples and information

This contains all the example code used in **Learning Web Components**, which you can find on [CodeRunDebug.com](https://coderundebug.com/learn/web-component/introduction/).

Use the `server.js` project to run the repo as a server and view the examples in your browser (using `Visual Studio Code` and `NodeJS`). Start it and point your browser to `localhost:3000`. There is no extra styling so it will look very basic.

Everything you see here is also on the [CodeRunDebug.com](https://coderundebug.com) web site, including live running examples. This should be the first place to look in order to understand the code in this repo better.

Everything here is free and unlicensed. You can use the code in your own projects if you need. You can use the material for teaching too. Please do not just copy everything and call it your own, God is watching you!
